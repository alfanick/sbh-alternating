Files are based on FASTA format.

Lines starting with ; (semicolon) mark beginning of section.
For Alternating chip two sections are allowed:
  ;ALTERNATING-O|k
  ;ALTERNATING-E|k
Where k is count of known nucleotides (that is ATGC).

After section definition multiple oligonucleotides are defined using 
ATGCX alphabet, where X is unknown nucleotide. In example:
  AXGXGXGXAXAA

Before oligo is defined number of its occurences may be specified as follows
  >i
Where i is number of occurences (usually 0,1,2) or N for greater number.
Number of occurences is in force as long as other number is given or 
new section is marked.
